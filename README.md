# Audio captions

Creates .json, .srt, .tsv, .txt and .vtt files using node whisper, a stepping stone for me in creating a Video-Auto-Captions web component.

## idea
We have the web speech API and the Web VTTCue to convert STT and add captions to videos respectively. My approach is to use them together and later come up with a new web API to generate auto-captions from videos in real-time.
